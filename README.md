DO “SHALL-ISSUE LAW” REDUCES CRIME OR NOT?

Overview

The impact of guns on crime in America has triggered a lot of public debate in the recent past. The proponents strongly believe that state laws enabling citizens to carry concealed handguns have reduced crime. Proponents argue that gun control laws take away guns from law-abiding citizens, which would leave potential victims defenseless.
Following this view, The National Rifle Association (NRA) and many politicians across the country advance the cause of greater freedom to carry guns. As a result, many states in the United States have passed right-to-carry laws (also known as a shall-issue laws). A Shall-issue law is one that requires that governments issue concealed carry handgun permits to any applicant who meets the necessary criteria. 
In this report, we analyze historical data on crime in the U.S to answer the question “Do shall-issues law reduce crime-or not?”
